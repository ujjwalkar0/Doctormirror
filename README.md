## Abstract

People are often unaware of doctors, hospitals, or ambulances in unknown places. Furthermore, when patients arrive in a hospital, their beds are not available, and the doctors they need are also unavailable. Now that Nobel Corona is in full swing, people need to know which hospitals can serve him and which cannot. An ambulance may not be able to reach the patient in some cases. Nursing care is required for some bedridden patients. We are proposing a website where medical services such as hospitals, doctors, nurses, ambulances, and patents can be found using their area codes. The website will assist the user in getting in touch with a doctor if they are experiencing physical health issues. There is a list of nearby hospitals, doctors, and ambulances. After seeing a patient's problem, a doctor may decide to prescribe medicine, or he may decide to admit the patient or tell the patient to come into the chamber in a message.

## Introduction

The web application will revolutionize the way medical services are contacted. Users will be able to locate doctors, hospitals, nurses, and ambulances if they have physical health issues. He will let the patient know if he feels the patient needs to be admitted or see a doctor. If he feels he can provide medication, he will provide the names of the medications. The patient can pay him online. The hospital that is willing to take the patient will send that
